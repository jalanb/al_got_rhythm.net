Experience
Senior SCM Engineer
S3 Group
January 2014 – Present (1 year 5 months)Cork, Ireland

Secured significant contracts from blue chip clients for S3 Group, scripting Blackduck's suite of tools to ensure Open Source Licence (and other) compliance in source code from large teams of developers in multiple companies. Pleased to find that the pedantry honed on programming questions is just as useful to legal ones.

Tools: Linux, Python, Bash, Git, Gerrit, Jenkins, Jira, ...

Interesting project: writing #licenses, #tags, ..., onto some Slack channels while conversing on others.

SCM
Altobridge
2005 – December 2013 (8 years)Tralee

Helped to grow the team to 150+.

I continuously integrated world-wide development teams and supported installation on a variety of platforms. We controlled release through Issue Trackers to System Test, Support and Customers, who provided mobile towers to remote lumberjacks (so we were OK).

Led the team effort which achieved DO-178B certification of development processes, and contributed to the overall ISO-9000 certification efforts.

I particularly enjoyed mentoring younger engineers, from internships through graduation and on to their own leadership positions.

Tools: Python, Javascript, Linux, SVN, SQL, source code translation, Blackduck, Selenium.

Interesting Project: Was asked to optimize a Java program, so profiled it, then adapted a Python parser to take away the syntactic sugar leaving code frames which gcc recognized as C, with some #includes. Profiled it again, re-wrote the framework, profiled again, added features.

Co Founder
Omnify Systems Ltd
2003 – 2005 (2 years)Tralee

Last time I programmed on Windows. But ask me about a podcast instead.

Leader.
interWAVE
1999 – 2003 (4 years)

On joining interWAVE I was responsible for transfer of the development of their OMC (Operations and Maintenance Centre) from Silicon Valley to Tralee, and then for all aspects of development in Tralee and for integration with other teams in America and China.

Tools: C++, Solaris, Networking, Telecoms, Rational

Interesting question: why does your diff engine compare text, not code?

Co Founder
Microcellular
1999 – 2001 (2 years)Tralee

I initially joined a startup company called Microcellular Systems, where we created a software team which developed software such as GSM subscriber management. This development team was a significant part of the reason why Microcellular was acquired by interWAVE.

Enterprise Ireland helped us to attract talent from Tralee's Institute of Technology which I built into a Team of 10 strong enough to be aquired by Interwave.

Interesting Project: Mapping locations of approaching GSM towers from a shed.

Tools: C, C++, Tcl/Tk, GSM, Windows

Coder
FlexTime
1994 – 2000 (6 years)Cork

I integrated Flextime's Windows-based system into the CSO (Central Statistics Office) VAX computers. Learned that the customer is always right, except when they think something might be "easy".

Interesting Project: Unit testing for The Millennium Bug.

Tools: COBOL, VMS.

Ability Developer
National Training and Development Institute
1995 – 1999 (4 years)Tralee

I helped differently abled people to use computers to better meet their needs. This was the toughest and most rewarding position I have undertaken.

Interesting challenge: Explain Visual Basic to someone who has heard Excel Macros. Listening to a programme being read by JAWS changes one's perspective, or one cannot help.

Teacher
Allied Computer Training
1989 – 1994 (5 years)Dublin, Ireland.

Developed a 2-year City & Guilds certified Software Engineering course on an i386 running Microfsoft Unix, way back, when they were still nerds.
