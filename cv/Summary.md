I have gained over 50,000 hours of Unix experience (with over 10,000 hours in Python, Bash, C, ...) while developing software, teaching teams and creating companies.

I would prefer to work in Kerry (Ireland), online, oder in LÃ¤ndern, in denen Deutsch gesprochen wird.

Currently specializing in Open Source Compliance, and have worked at all means of engineering value from software source code. I'm good at all the means we know about so far, but particularly interested in those no-one else seems to be thinking about, yet.
