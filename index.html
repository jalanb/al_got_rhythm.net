				<h3>Managing music</h3>
				<p>
					I like too much music, and <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">iTunes</a> has
					a <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/ie/terms.html#SERVICE">hard time</a> keeping up,
                    as does the phone, old phone, usb sticks, work laptop, ...
                    I download just over 2 albums a week, and rate new songs before transfer
					to listeners (phone, ...)

                    My machine, "jab.ook", is OS X 10.7, phones are Android 4.2, and N900, and a Nexus in the kitchen, other machines are generally Linux.
                    Backups to net disk at home, and replace the HD in jab.ook every couple of years. Considering cloud, and dev server.
                    (Pro tip: always buy a second copy of a HD: "Well we could've restored it if we had parts")
                    Home network is shite, but I'm promised 4G in a couple of years. Distribution from jab.ook is via USB.

                    Skills: mash tapes for driving and bash/python, decades of coding.

                    Wanted:
                        left/right -> colour changes RGB, up/down -> BW
                        choose - start a song of that colour
                        count number of times that song is not put away
                        next song: prefer close album, close colour, not played recently, not heard in ages, rating, ...
                        this song: change rating and colour

                        Show album cover, Artist above, other local tracks. Next album should peek out on the right (viz Xperia Walkman).
                        Pulling the next album to the left plays it now.
                        Pulling the current album to the right restarts this song.

                    Current players:
                        jab.ook - iTunes
                        phone - ? (Fusion/Walkman. As apps they are "close, but no cigar")
                        N900 - N900 Media Player
                        Nexus - Fusion (which loses my album covers, GRrrr)

					I listen to music tracks randomly from the phone

				<h3>Losing weight</h3>
				<p>

					In the 11 months leading down from January 2012 I lost over 36 kg to arrive at my goal weight yesterday: 77.7kg.
					I did this by weighing myself daily, and using <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com">myfitnesspal.com</a> 
					to record pretty much every calorie that I ate. I did not really "follow a diet", just educated myself
					about the calorie content of what I typically ate, and preferred those with lower calories. It was also 
					important to become aware of how I was eating, especially to notice that I did not eat because I was hungry.
					Now the second half: maintain 77.7 for the next year.

				<h3>New blog</h3>
				<p>
					The old blog was hosted by Google, 
					but I <a href="http://aivipi.blogspot.com/2009/03/apparently-i-am-not-not-alone.html">got annoyed</a> 
					by their habit of following me around the net, so I joined up with over to 
					<a href="http://alanbrogan.brandyourself.com/">Alan Brogan</a>'s pages instead.
